This work extends earlier text-to-face generation research by leveraging state-of-the-art generative models to produce more realistic and diverse facial images from Bangla text descriptions.

**Key Contributions:**
- Supported by a research project funded by the Institute of Energy, Environment, Research and Development (IEERD) at UAP
- Prepared the research proposal that secured a $3,000 grant
- Developed a system leveraging Stable Diffusion (less prone to mode collapse than GANs) for realistic image generation
- Integrated BanglaBERT (ELECTRA-based language model) for accurate Bangla text embeddings
- Significantly improved image quality compared to GAN-based approaches
- Contributed substantially to writing and publication process

This research demonstrates the effectiveness of diffusion models over GANs for text-to-image generation, particularly in addressing issues like mode collapse, unstable training, and non-convergence.

**Funding:** Institute of Energy, Environment, Research and Development (IEERD), University of Asia Pacific (~$3,000)
