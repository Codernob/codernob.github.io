This work, based on my undergraduate thesis "MukhLekha: An End-to-End System for Generating Face Images from Bangla Text," introduces the first Bangla text-to-face generation system, marking a significant milestone in multimodal AI for low-resource languages.

**Key Contributions:**
- Implemented the first text-to-image generation system for Bangla using GAN and FastText models
- Developed a novel algorithm to create a custom dataset based on the popular CelebA dataset
- Generated facial attribute annotations in Bangla aligned with facial images
- Leveraged DCGAN architecture for image generation
- Used Bangla FastText embeddings to capture semantic information from text descriptions
- Demonstrated feasibility of cross-modal generation for low-resource languages

This pioneering work opened new research directions in Bangla text-to-image generation and inspired subsequent improvements using diffusion models.

**Applications:** Advertising, forensics, animation, entertainment, and digital content creation
