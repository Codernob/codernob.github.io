This work introduces IndicDialogue, a comprehensive multilingual dataset containing subtitles from 10 low-resource Indic languages, addressing the scarcity of conversational data for these languages.

**Key Contributions:**
- Corresponded with opensubtitles.org to obtain data across 10 Indic languages
- Curated and preprocessed subtitle data for language modeling tasks
- Fine-tuned a GPT-2 model on the dataset, demonstrating significant improvement in generated outputs
- Validated dataset utility through multiple downstream NLP tasks:
  - Text generation
  - Word similarity evaluation
  - Word analogy tasks
- Provided a valuable resource for the research community working on low-resource Indic languages

The dataset fills a critical gap in resources for Indic language NLP and enables research in dialogue systems, language modeling, and transfer learning for these underrepresented languages.
