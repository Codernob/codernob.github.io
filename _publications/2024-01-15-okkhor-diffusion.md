This work introduces a DDPM-based approach for generating high-quality Bangla handwritten characters, addressing the need for synthetic data generation in low-resource language contexts.

**Key Contributions:**
- Guided two undergraduate students in developing the proposed DDPM architecture
- Designed a novel U-Net architecture optimized for noising and denoising Bangla characters
- Proposed a custom evaluation metric for more accurate quality assessment
- Addressed the limitation of standard Inception-v3 FID metric by training it on Bangla handwritten character classification tasks
- Demonstrated domain-authentic evaluation by using Bangla-trained embeddings for FID calculation

This research provides a robust foundation for synthetic handwritten character generation in Bangla, with applications in OCR training, data augmentation, and digital font development.
