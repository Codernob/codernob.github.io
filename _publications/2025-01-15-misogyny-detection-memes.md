This work developed a hate-aware multimodal approach for detecting misogyny in memes, achieving runner-up position in the shared task competition.

**Key Contributions:**
- Employed Large Language Models for extracting rich semantic information using text embeddings
- Used CLIP models for obtaining accurate image latents
- Trained an efficient MLP for detecting misogyny from combined image and text embeddings
- Demonstrated effective integration of vision transformers and text transformers for multimodal classification

This research addresses the important problem of detecting harmful content in memes, which require understanding both visual and textual components.

**Achievement:** Runner-up in the Misogyny Meme Detection Shared Task at DravidianLangTech@NAACL 2025
