Hello! I'm Noor Mairukh Khan Arnob

My research is centered on developing multimodal generative AI systems that work effectively across diverse languages and modalities. I focus particularly on addressing gaps in representation for low-resource languages like Bangla, which limits AI's global applicability.

My goal is to advance generative modeling techniques while ensuring these technologies serve diverse linguistic and cultural contexts, ultimately contributing to more robust and ethical AI systems.

Research Highlights

Generative AI: Developed novel systems for text-to-face generation using DCGAN and Stable Diffusion, incorporating Bangla-specific models like BanglaBERT.

Bias & Trustworthy AI: Assessed gender bias in 11 pretrained Bangla language models using custom datasets and proposed evaluation metrics (published at ACL 2025).

Low-Resource NLP: Created IndicDialogue, a multilingual dataset of subtitles for 10 Indic languages to support language modeling efforts.

Teaching & Mentorship: Currently serve as a Lecturer at the University of Asia Pacific (UAP) where I teach courses like Machine Learning and co-convene the Programming Contest Club.

I am an incoming Fall 2026 CS PhD Applicant committed to interdisciplinary collaboration and real-world impact. Feel free to explore my work and reach out!
