Welcome! I am Noor Mairukh Khan Arnob, a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Asia Pacific (UAP), Bangladesh. I am currently applying for PhD programs starting Fall 2026, with research interests centered on developing multimodal generative AI systems that work effectively across languages and modalities.

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on advancing generative modeling techniques while ensuring these technologies serve diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. I am particularly passionate about:

* **Multimodal Generative AI**: Developing systems that bridge text, images, and other modalities, with a focus on diffusion models, GANs, and transformer-based architectures
* **Low-Resource Language Technologies**: Addressing representation gaps in AI for underrepresented languages, particularly Bangla and other Indic languages
* **Fairness and Bias in AI**: Detecting and mitigating gender bias and other forms of bias in pretrained language models and multimodal systems
* **Text-to-Image Generation**: Creating robust systems for generating realistic images from textual descriptions using state-of-the-art generative models
* **Edge AI and Efficient Inference**: Deploying neural networks on resource-constrained devices for real-world applications

Academic Background
======
I graduated first in my class from the University of Asia Pacific with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering (CGPA: 3.97/4.00), earning the Vice Chancellor's Gold Medal. My undergraduate thesis introduced the first Bangla text-to-face generation system, which ignited my passion for multimodal generative AI and has shaped my research trajectory ever since.

Research Contributions
======
I have published 6 peer-reviewed papers (4 journal articles and 2 conference papers) in venues including IEEE Access, Data in Brief, ACL 2025, and NAACL 2025. My work spans:

* **Text-to-Image Generation**: Developed multiple systems for generating face images from Bangla text using GANs, Stable Diffusion, and BanglaBERT
* **Generative Models for Low-Resource Scripts**: Created Okkhor-Diffusion, a DDPM-based system for generating Bangla handwritten characters
* **Bias Detection**: Assessed gender bias in 11 pretrained Bangla language models using comprehensive numerical and visual evaluation methods
* **Dataset Development**: Built IndicDialogue, a multilingual dataset of subtitles in 10 Indic languages for language modeling tasks
* **Multimodal Classification**: Developed ensemble approaches for misogyny detection in memes using vision transformers and BERT models

Beyond Research
======
I am deeply committed to teaching and mentoring the next generation of researchers. At UAP, I teach courses including Structured Programming, Numerical Methods, Operating Systems, and Machine Learning. I also serve as Co-convener and Coach of the UAP Programming Contest Club, where I guide students in competitive programming and organize technical events.

I have contributed to the research community as a peer reviewer for IEEE Access, problem-setter for the HerWILL AI For Equality Datathon 2024, and judge for international AI competitions. I have also collaborated with researchers from Georgia Tech and mentored undergraduate students in their research projects.

Looking Forward
======
I am excited to pursue doctoral studies where I can continue advancing multimodal generative AI systems, particularly focusing on making these technologies more robust, efficient, and accessible across diverse languages and cultures. I aim to contribute to building AI systems that are not only technically sophisticated but also ethically sound and globally inclusive.

Feel free to explore my [publications](/publications/), [teaching experience](/teaching/), and [CV](/cv/) to learn more about my work. I am always open to research collaborations and discussions about generative AI, low-resource language technologies, and fairness in machine learning.
